Package: readit
Title: Effortlessly Read Any Rectangular Data
Description:
    'readit' provides just one primary function, readit(), which uses a set of
    reasonable heuristics to apply the appropriate reader function to the
    given file path. As long as the file has an extension, and the data is
    rectangular, `readit` can read it.
